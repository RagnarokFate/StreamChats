# Tasks: StreamChats Product Roadmap

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/007-product-roadmap/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks where manual verification requires specific setup. Automated tests are prioritized for the Event Bus and core moderation logic as per the spec.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for new packages and apps

- [x] T001 Create new packages `event-bus`, `identity`, `analytics`, `plugin-sdk`, `obs-integration` under `packages/` with `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`
- [x] T002 Create new CLI workspace `streamchats-cli` under `tools/` with `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`
- [x] T003 Create new Tauri app `desktop` under `apps/` using `@tauri-apps/api`
- [x] T004 Run `npm install` from repository root to link workspaces
- [x] T005 Create empty `src/` directories and `index.ts` entry points for all new packages

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Install `better-sqlite3` and `zod` in `packages/event-bus`
- [x] T007 Implement SQLite `store.ts` with WAL mode and tables: `events`, `sessions`, `stream_markers`, `viewer_identities`, `platform_accounts`, `reputation_entries` in `packages/event-bus/src/store.ts`
- [x] T008 Implement `EventBus` class (publish, subscribe, replay from offset) in `packages/event-bus/src/index.ts`
- [x] T009 Implement `StreamSession` lifecycle management (start, end, rotate after 14 days, check 80% capacity) in `packages/event-bus/src/session.ts`
- [x] T010 [P] Update `packages/event-schema/src/index.ts` to include expanded types: `GiftEvent`, `FollowEvent`, `RaidEvent`, `SuperChatEvent`, `StreamEvent` base with `sequenceNumber` and `moderationStatus`
- [x] T011 [P] Update `packages/event-schema/src/index.ts` to include WS Protocol v2 command types
- [x] T012 Add Event Bus integration tests verifying at-least-once delivery and offset tracking in `packages/event-bus/tests/event-bus.test.ts`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Resilient Multi-Platform Chat Aggregation (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Connectors survive individual platform failures via circuit breakers, emit expanded event types (gift/follow/raid/superchat), and route all events through the Event Bus

**Independent Test**: Simulate a connector failure (disconnect one platform mid-stream) and verify remaining platforms continue. Trigger gift/follow/raid events on test channels and verify they appear as normalized events.

- [x] T021 [US1] Replace direct `EventEmitter` pipeline with Event Bus integration in `apps/local-server/src/index.ts` — connectors publish to Event Bus, consumers subscribe
- [x] T022 [US1] Add session management (start session on server boot, end on graceful shutdown, detect crashed sessions on startup) in `apps/local-server/src/index.ts`
- [x] T023 [US1] Add `ConnectorSupervisor` initialization and health status broadcasting via WS `status_update` in `apps/local-server/src/server.ts`
- [x] T024 [US1] Add `stream_event` broadcast (v2 protocol) as an Event Bus consumer alongside existing v1 `chat_message` for backward compatibility in `apps/local-server/src/server.ts`

- [x] T053 [P] [US4] Implement post-stream report generator calculating peak engagement windows based on rolling 1-minute averages in `packages/analytics/src/reports.ts`

- [x] T083 Final end-to-end manual test of all User Stories in sequence

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)

### Implementation Strategy

#### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

#### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Stories 5, 6, 7 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo

- [x] T086 [Bug] Markers are not stored properly: upon F5-refresh they are deleted.
- [x] T087 [Bug] Stream Statistics is not showing anything: total messages, unique chatters, and messages/min are empty.
- [x] T088 [Bug] Session replay is recording from the start of the first run which is inefficient.
- [x] T089 [Bug] Plugin autowelcomer is not doing anything after installation.
- [x] T090 [Bug] Moderation view doesn't render inline ban/timeout buttons correctly in the overlay.
